This project examines customer data from AeroFit, a treadmill company, to understand what type of customers prefer different treadmill models. Using Python tools, we look at customer details like age, gender, and income to find patterns. The goal is to help AeroFit make better decisions about who to market each treadmill to, improving customer satisfaction and business success.

## Business Problem
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.
* Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
* Construct two-way contingency tables for each AeroFit treadmill product and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities and their insights/impact on the business.

## Insights & Recommendations
1. Only 18% of female customers have purchased KP781, indicating that the product is not as popular among this demographic. This suggests a potential gap in marketing efforts, as it appears the product may not have been effectively targeted toward female customers. To tap into this market segment and increase KP781's appeal among females, the company should consider tailoring its marketing strategies specifically for the female audience.


2. The likelihood of purchasing is almost consistent across all three products for male customers. However, among single male customers, the probability of buying KP281 is notably higher at 44%, whereas KP481 exhibits the lowest probability with just 23% chance of being sold.


3. Among female customers, the highest probability of purchasing is associated with KP281 at 53%, while the lowest probability is observed for KP781 with only a 9% chance of being sold. However, when considering single female customers, KP481 emerges as the product with the highest probability (47%) of being sold, boasting a 47% probability of purchase.


4. The majority of the Aerofit treadmill customers fall between the age range of 20 to 35 years, indicating a target demographic of younger individuals. However, for KP781, the age range narrows further, with most customers being between 20 to 30 years old. But there is a consistent distribution of customers between the ages of 35 to 47 years, suggesting that older individuals also prefer KP781, although the number of customers in this age group is comparatively lower. This observation suggests that the product KP781 has appeal across different age groups, but its primary attraction remains among younger customers.


5. In the case of product KP481, the median age of male customers is lower than that of female customers. This suggests that younger men have a higher chance of buying KP481 compared to females. In other words, the product seems to be more popular among younger male customers compared to female customers, whose median age is higher.


6. Younger customers (age <= 25 years) show a preference for purchasing KP781 when their income exceeds $50,000. On the other hand, for older customers (age > 25 years), the probability of buying KP781 increases significantly when their income surpasses $70,000. For customers with an income less than $50,000 or aged over 25 years, the primary choices tend to be KP281 or KP481.


7. Similar to the age pattern, single individuals exhibit a preference for purchasing KP781 even when their salary is slightly lower (salary >= $50,000). In contrast, partnered customers tend to favor KP781 when their salary is relatively higher (salary >= $65,000). This observation is practically justifiable as single individuals typically have fewer expenses compared to married individuals, allowing them to allocate more of their income towards higher-tier products like KP781. On the other hand, partnered customers may prioritize other financial responsibilities, leading them to opt for KP781 when their income is more comfortable.


8. Highly educated (with 18 years of education or more) individuals usually have higher incomes and tend to prefer the higher variant (KP781). An interesting observation is that individuals with at least 18 years of education favor KP781 even when their salary is as low as $50,000, indicating a strong preference for the higher variant among highly educated customers. On the other hand, those with less than 18 years of education tend to choose KP781 only when their income is above $65,000. Otherwise, they prefer the lower or mid-range products (KP281 or KP481). This finding highlights that highly educated customers have a strong inclination towards the higher-end product, regardless of their income level.


9. Customers who are willing to cover a distance of 100 miles or more in a week and have an income greater than $60,000 have a higher probability of purchasing the product KP781. 


10. Like the above insights, customers who are willing to invest at least 4 days in a week and have an income of at least $60,000 also have higher chances of buying the product KP781. This finding suggests that customers who are financially capable and committed to using the treadmill frequently are more likely to invest in the top-tier product option.


11. Fitness enthusiast customers (with a fitness rating of 4 or higher) show a tendency to buy KP781 even when their income is relatively low (salary >= $55,000). However, customers with a fitness rating of less than 4, usually prefer either KP281 or KP481. In cases where the fitness rating is less than 4, the probability of buying KP781 increases slightly when the customer's income exceeds $70,000.
